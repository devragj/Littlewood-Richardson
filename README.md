This is so far the early stages of a project.  The goal is webpages useful for computations and display involving Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for classical Weyl groups other than type A<sub>n</sub>.  This work is in collaboration with Emily Sergel.
The base code comes from the repo at https://github.com/devragj/devragj.github.io.

To use the pages online, please go to https://devragj.github.io/Littlewood-Richardson/.
